# RAG
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for document-based question answering (QA), combining a dense retrieval mechanism with a generative model to provide contextually accurate and efficient answers.
Key Features:

Dense Retriever: Utilizes BERT embeddings to retrieve the most relevant documents from a corpus based on user queries.
Generative Model: Employs a GPT-based model to generate human-like responses from the retrieved documents, ensuring accuracy and fluency in answers.
End-to-End Pipeline: Integrates retriever and generator into a unified RAG pipeline, optimized for quick and relevant response generation.
Data Preprocessing: Includes tokenization, text normalization, and embedding techniques to enhance retrieval accuracy.
Technologies:

Python
Hugging Face Transformers (BERT, GPT)
PyTorch
Elasticsearch
Scikit-learn
Usage:
Clone the repository and follow the setup instructions to run the RAG pipeline locally. The system can be adapted for various applications, including customer support bots, knowledge bases, or research assistance.
